### Explore

The explore page shows trending and recently uploaded works. You can also view works under a specific category by clicking on the category of interest.

By clicking on the search box you can search and select multiple works. When you click the search button these works will be displayed and you can click on their title to go to their cover page

### Profile


As you are logged in, you will be directed to the internal view of the profile page.

By clicking the edit button you can modify your biography. The downloads section shows the works that you've downloaded. These are the works you select from when stating the works you've referenced/featured. The works section shows the works you've made.

With the temporary external view button, you can view the external profile version. The biography cannot be edited, and you can see the userâ€™s interests and works. You can follow or unfollow them using the follow button. You can also report them but must give a reason. For example, they may not be abiding by the site's rule of referencing works that are featured in their work.

On both views you can see a list of followers and followings of the user by clicking on their respective headings in the sidebar. Clicking on the username will direct you to their profile page.

In the Internal profile view, you can access the upload work page. Here you can enter the details for the work you want to upload. You can select an audio and image file. You must reference works that you feature using the section at the bottom of the page. You select the reference work from the options, which are your downloaded works and you can add a description of how the work was used. Using the + button, you can add a reference and you can use the - button to remove a reference. You must add a second reference before you have the option to remove one. Clicking the upload button clears all inputs allowing you to upload another work.

You can also access the profile settings page. Here you can edit your profile name, email, and interests but you cannot edit your username. You can change your profile photo as well as your password. Inputting an old password that is not "user" will bring up an error alert, as well as passwords that don't match.

### Cover Page

The cover page has both an internal and external view that can be toggled using the temporary button. In both views you can play the work, view its description and go to its feature history page.

In the external view, you can like or unlike the work, download it, report it, and leave comments.

In the internal view, any comments you leave are highlighted and you can delete them using the button located within the comment box (may need to scroll to see it depending on your screen size). Clicking the edit button allows you to edit the post's content. By cancelling or saving the changes, you will be directed back to the cover page.

### Features

Using the feature button on a work's cover page, you can see all the works that it features (parent works) and works that it is featured in (children works). The works are displayed like music notes on a music sheet and you can scroll through each section. By clicking on a music note, a card pops up with the work's title and artist, as well as a description of how it was used. By clicking on the title, you will be directed to the work's cover page. Clicking on the title of the work in the "Feature History" title will take you back to its cover page.
